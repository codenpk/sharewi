This is an attempt to implement an integrated vehicle route problem solver using AppFuse and other J2EE technologies. 
The project is considered to be a learning exercise, but it could find its application with a Wisconsin non-profit discount-foods organization.

The mathematics involved in this project are relevant to the Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (OVRPTW) subfamily of VRP combinatorics problems.
